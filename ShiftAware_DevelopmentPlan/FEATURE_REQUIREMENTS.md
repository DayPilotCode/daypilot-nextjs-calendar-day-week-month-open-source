## FR-002: Shift Configuration

### User Story
As an administrator, I need to define shift types, times, and team compositions.

### Requirements
- Define shift structure:
  - 2x Mobile teams (2 people each)
  - 1x Stationary team (2 people, 1 is shift lead)
  - 1x Executive shift
- Set shift times (Thursday to Monday midday + buffer days)
- Mark core event shifts vs. buffer shifts
- Define shift desirability ratings

### Data Model
```typescript
type ShiftType = 'mobile' | 'stationary' | 'executive'
type ShiftRole = 'team_member' | 'shift_lead' | 'executive'

interface Shift {
  id: string
  type: ShiftType
  startTime: DateTime
  endTime: DateTime
  requiredRoles: ShiftRole[]
  capacity: number
  priority: 'core' | 'buffer'
  desirabilityScore: number // 1-5 scale
}
```

## FR-003: User Profile Management

  - Experience level (junior, intermediate, senior)
  - Gender role (for balance constraints)
  - Shift role capabilities
  - Avatar assignment
- Manual profile editing by admin only
- Secure alias mapping (separate from main DB)

### Data Model
```typescript
interface TeamMember {
  id: string
  alias: string // e.g., "Wolf", "Eagle"
  avatarId: string
  experienceLevel: 'junior' | 'intermediate' | 'senior'
  genderRole: string // For balance only
  capabilities: ShiftRole[]
  notes?: string
}
```

## FR-004: Shift Assignment Algorithm

### User Story
As an administrator, I want the system to optimally assign shifts based on preferences and constraints.

### Algorithm Requirements

#### Constraints (Hard)
1. Minimum 2 shifts per person
2. Each shift filled to capacity
3. Shift lead qualification required
4. No person in overlapping shifts
5. Experience balance per team (mix of levels)
6. Gender balance per team

#### Optimization Goals (Soft)
1. Maximize preference satisfaction
2. Distribute unpopular shifts fairly
3. Balance workload across team members
4. Prioritize core event coverage

#### Scoring System
```typescript
interface AssignmentScore {
  preferenceMatch: number    // 0-100 (higher = better)
  experienceBalance: number  // 0-100 (100 = perfect mix)
  genderBalance: number      // 0-100 (100 = balanced)
  workloadFairness: number   // 0-100 (100 = equal distribution)
  coreShiftCoverage: number  // 0-100 (100 = all filled)
  overall: number           // Weighted average
}
```

#### Weights Configuration
```javascript
const weights = {
  preferenceMatch: 0.35,
  experienceBalance: 0.25,
  genderBalance: 0.20,
  workloadFairness: 0.15,
  coreShiftCoverage: 0.05
}
```

### Algorithm Approach
1. **Initialization**: Assign preferred shifts where possible
2. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Fill mandatory requirements
3. **Optimization**: Use weighted scoring for remaining assignments
4. **Random Assignment**: Uncovered shifts assigned randomly from available pool
5. **Validation**: Check all constraints satisfied

### Transparency Requirement
- Explain each assignment decision
- Show constraint violations (if any)
- Display optimization scores
- Allow admin to see alternative assignments

### Priority: **P0 (Critical)**
