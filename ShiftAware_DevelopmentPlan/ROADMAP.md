## Development Guidelines

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning:** Review previous day, plan tasks
2. **Development:** Focus on one feature at a time
3. **Testing:** Write tests alongside code
4. **Commit:** Atomic commits with conventional messages
5. **Review:** End-of-day code review and documentation

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode enabled
- **Testing:** >70% code coverage
- **Linting:** Zero ESLint errors
- **Formatting:** Prettier auto-format on save
- **Documentation:** JSDoc for complex functions
- **Performance:** Lighthouse score >90

### Git Workflow
```bash
main (protected)
  └── develop
       ├── feature/auth
       ├── feature/algorithm
       └── feature/export
```

**Branch Naming:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code improvements
- `docs/` - Documentation

**Commit Messages:**
```
feat(auth): implement session management
fix(algorithm): correct experience balance calculation
docs(api): add endpoint documentation
test(algorithm): add constraint validation tests
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
```javascript
// Algorithm functions
test('calculatePreferenceScore returns correct value', () => {
  const score = calculatePreferenceScore(member, shift);
  expect(score).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

// Utility functions
test('validateShiftOverlap detects conflicts', () => {
  expect(validateShiftOverlap(shift1, shift2)).toBe(true);
});
```

### Integration Tests (Vitest + Supertest)
```javascript
// API endpoints
test('POST /api/preferences creates preference', async () => {
  const response = await request(app)
    .post('/api/preferences')
    .send({ shiftId, priority: 1 })
    .expect(201);
  expect(response.body.id).toBeDefined();
});
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
```javascript
// Critical user flows
test('user can submit preferences', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('[name="password"]', testPassword);
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await page.goto('/preferences');
  await page.click('[data-shift-id="shift1"]');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Submit")');
  await expect(page.locator('.success-message')).toBeVisible();
});
```
